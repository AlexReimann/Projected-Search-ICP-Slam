Projected-Search-ICP-Slam (Title is work in progress...)
=========================

Implementation of fast cpu based ICP algroithm for kinect etc. using restricted search in depth frame

Uses Eigen Library (http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/) for calculations.

Uses mrpt (http://www.mrpt.org/) for reading in data file (http://cvpr.in.tum.de/data/datasets/rgbd-dataset/) in the main, could be changed to use kinect input.

Uses boost (http://www.boost.org/) currently only for stopping time (if I remember correctly, so would work without it).
